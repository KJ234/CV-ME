        <h4>Mood-Tracker</h4>
        <P>In this project we created a platform to track your own and friend's mental wellbeing. Our motivation behind this is to support peopleâ€™s mental health through self help. Our initial plan for this application was to have a custom slider, where a user chooses their daily mood (from between 0 and 10) a graph of their moods throughout the week is generated. We achieved this goal and implemented additional features. The two main additional features we added is the ability to view other user's mood graphs and being able to put in a mood level for a past missed day. The problem that our application solves is it boosts positivity in the current circumstances of the world.</P>

        <h4>Note-Pad</h4>
        <P>The motivation for this app is that staying organised is crucial to being a successful worker, and a note-taking app can help someone stay on top of their tasks. This project's goal is to emphasise the use of middleware, routes, and express. Along with that, I used Heroku to deploy this application.</P>

        <h4>Team Profile Generator</h4>
        <P>In this project, I built a Node.js command line application that collects information about software engineering team members and generates an HTML webpage with summaries for each of them. My motivation for creating this project was to investigate the use of testing in my application using the jest package, as testing is critical to code maintainability. Another new area I investigated in this project was the use of classes as templates for creating new JavaScript objects.</P>

        <h4>Weather Dashboard</h4>
        <P>This is a weather dashboard that will change HTML and CSS based on form inputs. It allows users to look at the weather in many cities at the same time, allowing travellers to plan their trips accordingly. The API that I use in this project is OpenWeather One Call API, which let me retrieve weather data for different cities. The central things I use in this project is: my OpenWeather key API, local storage and the use of icons.</P>
